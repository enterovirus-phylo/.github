# Enterovirus Phylo

This repository serves as the central hub for the Enterovirus Phylo project, a collaborative initiative with the European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network (ENPEN).

### Purpose

- **Nextclade Datasets**: This repository is where we curate and publish Nextclade datasets specific to enteroviruses, enabling rapid assessment and phylogenetic placement of new sequences.
- **Nextstrain Builds (EV-D68)**: We also store historical Nextstrain builds for Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), allowing the research community to access and explore previous phylogenetic analyses.

### Collaboration

This project is developed and maintained in collaboration with **ENPEN**, aiming to enhance surveillance and understanding of enterovirus evolutionary dynamics.

### Get Involved

If you'd like to contribute, report issues, or use these datasets in your own research, please open an issue or pull request on the respective repository.
